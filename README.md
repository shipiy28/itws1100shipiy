To test comments, open comments page on the server, after including the siteComments database with the given SQL imported.

AI helped a lot with every section. Most of all with the styling, but it was able to help me make functions that interacted with styling, saving me a lot of time. The loadComments function in particular was made by AI, since I'm not very good at that level of styling. It worked best when I gave it thoughtful descriptions of what I needed it to do. It also helped me with validating the email format, something I was unsure of how to do.
